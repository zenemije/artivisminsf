                <p>San Francisco is famously known to be one of the most artistic metropolitan cities in the world. Murals line the streets from corner to corner of this 7x7 mile creative hub.</p>
                    
                    <p>The video below offers just a glimpe into the vibrant imagery you'll find in San Francisco's Mission District, one of the most visually stunning neighborhoods in the Bay Area.</p>

                <p>The murals of San Francisco’s Mission District have come to evoke bittersweet emotions within the community these days. While the vibrant colors of fresh paint are known to be a staple of pride in the neighborhood, the incessant loss of life at the hands of police brutality serves as one of the most common inspirations for these murals that seem to be sprouting more and more frequently. One of the latest was unveiled in November of last year on the busy corner of 24th and Capp Street just above the Calle24 Latino Cultural District offices.</p>

                <p>"Alto al Fuego en La Misión" began as a mural solely dedicated to Amilcar Perez Lopez, a Ch’orti’ Mayan immigrant from Guatemala and beloved Mission resident who was wrongfully murdered by the SFPD on February 26, 2015. What’s grown from this project, however, has become an expansive altar for honoring several Black and Brown folks who had been slain at the hands of police and border officers over the past couple of years. The additional lives depicted in the mural are that of Mario Woods, Alex Nieto, Luis Gongora Pat, Jesus Adolfo Delgado, Roxana Hernandez, Claudia Patricia Gomez González and Oscar and Valeria Martinez.</p>

                <p>Father Richard of the Justice4Amilcar Coalition, in collaboration with Amilcar’s family, Precita Eyes Muralists, Mission Housing Development Corporation and Homies Organizing the Mission to Empower Youth (HOMEY) initiated the 2-year-long process. Recruited artists Carla Elana Wojczuk, Lucía González Ippolito, Flavia Elisa Mora, Cristian Muńoz, Anna Lisa Escobedo, Adrianna Adams, Pancho Pescador and Sonia G. Molina brought the vision to life.</p>
                
                <p>The mural is oriented as a retablo—a stoic portrait of Amilcar on one side and a portrayal of Amiclar’s family holding a message on the other. The message reads “Familia Perez Lopez declare justice for the assassination of our son, assassinated 26/02/15 by the police of San Francisco, CA. Amilcar Perez.” Amid the rolling landscapes transitioning from Guatemala to San Francisco lie novena candles with portraits of others who were wrongfully killed, their faces illuminating the dark consequences of militarization in Black and Brown communities.</p>
